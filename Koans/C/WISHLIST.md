### Wishlist
* Use C11 _Generic interface for a top level `c_koans_assert()` macro that will
expand to the correct `cr_assert()`.

* Come up with a suggested order to have a decent flow such that each koan done
will not require too many mental leaps in learning

* Some sort of driver to make the koans ordered & interactive ala ruby koans.

* If the above point isn't met first, an interactive IO koan that's a separate
executable. This koan would be much easier if input interaction could be done

* Make the buffered IO koan interesting

* Make the IO koan interesting

* Expanded \*nix and Windows specific C topics that are more inclined to
introductory OS material (this may enter a realm of \*nix koans or windows koans?)
