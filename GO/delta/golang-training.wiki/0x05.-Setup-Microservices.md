# Setup tools & environment to do microservice exercises

## Protobuf

### Installation

Visit [here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/gotutorial) for first steps to download and install protobuf, and protobuf with Golang

> It's hard and complicated so please be patient.

- For MacOS you can use `brew`
- For Ubuntu/Linux

### Setup Golang Protobuf

Visit [here](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go) to see how to setup `grpc-go`. Easily, you just install go package:

```shell
$ go get -u google.golang.org/grpc
```

> Note: gRPC-Go requires Go 1.9 or later.

Visit [here](https://github.com/micro/go-micro) to see how to setup and for examples.

## Setup Consul

[Consul](https://www.consul.io/) is a distributed service mesh to connect, secure, and configure services across any runtime platform and public or private cloud

You can see `week5-exercise` to see how to start Consul with Docker

```yml
consul:
  command: -server -bootstrap -rejoin 
  image: progrium/consul:latest
  ports:
    - "8300:8300"
    - "8400:8400"
    - "8500:8500"
