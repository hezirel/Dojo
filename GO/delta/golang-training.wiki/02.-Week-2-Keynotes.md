## Pointer in Go

- **Java**

 <summary>Source code</summary>

```java
class Point {
  int x = 0;
  int y = 0;
  public Point(int x, int y) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
  }
}
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Point p1 = new Point(10, 11);
    System.out.println("[x = "+p1.x +",y="+ p1.y+"]");
    Point p2 = p1;
    p2.x = -9;
    System.out.println("[x = "+p1.x +",y="+ p1.y+"]");
  }
}
```

  var $y = 0;

  public function __construct($x, $y){
    $this->x = $x;
    $this->y = $y;
  }

## Discover goroutines, channel, defer, panic, recover

### Concurrency model

1. Go uses the concurrency model called Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
2. The parts(threads) of an application(process) that run concurrently are called goroutines in Go

### Working with Goroutines

- See example: concurrency-goroutines-await

- https://www.ardanlabs.com/blog/2018/08/scheduling-in-go-part1.html

### Working with Channels

- See example: gorountine-pipline

### Deferred Functions Calls

- See example: concurrency-goroutines-await

### Panic and Recover

- See doc: [Panic and Recover](02.-Week-2-Golang-Basic-3#panic-and-recover)

## Error handling in Go

If you have written any Go code you have probably encountered the built-in error type. Go code uses error values to indicate an abnormal state. For example, the os.Open function returns a non-nil error value when it fails to open a file.

```go
func Open(name string) (file *File, err error)
```

The following code uses os.Open to open a file. If an error occurs it calls log.Fatal to print the error message and stop.

```go
f, err := os.Open("filename.ext")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatal(err)
}
// do something with the open \*File f
```

You can get a lot done in Go knowing just this about the error type, but in this article we'll take a closer look at error and discuss some good practices for error handling in Go.
