# `02` Create an instance of a `DateTime`

Javascript has some pre-defined classes that you can use whenever you want. One of these classes is the DateTime class, created to help developers work with dates and times. 

For example, to print the current date, we can use the DateTime class like this:

```js
let d = new Date();
console.log(d);
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a new Date object with format month-day-year and print it on the console like this:

`Today is: 8-23-2018`


## 💡 Hint:

The `Date` class comes with 3 functions that help you get the day, month and year of the original date.

+ This exercise has ~3 lines of code, it's VERY similar to the example.

+ Here is a very good documentation of the `Date` class:
