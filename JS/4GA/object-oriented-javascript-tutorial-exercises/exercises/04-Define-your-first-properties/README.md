# `04` Define your first properties

The current code has a class Person definition without any properties or functions; to define a property, you need use the following syntax:

```js
class ClassName{    
    constructor(){
        this.foo = 'bar'
    }
}
```


## üìù Instructions:

1. Using the `camelCase` naming convention, add the following properties to the Person class:

```txt
Name: Bob
Last Name: Dylan
Birth Date: May 24, 1941
```

All property values must be strings.
