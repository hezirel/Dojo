## `08` Create Simple Class

Right now, there is a Counter class declared that contains 4 functions: 

+ `constructor`: This function will initialize the value of the counter.

+ `increaseOne`: This function will increase the value of the counter by one.

+ `decreaseOne`: This function will decrease the value of the counter by one.

+ `getValue`: This function will return the value of the counter.


All functions are empty.

## 📝 Instructions

Your job is to fill them with the proper code needed to make it work as expected:

1. Fill the content of the class `Counter` to make it behave as expected.

## 💡 Hint: 

+ Initialize a variable `this.counter` and use it in every function.
