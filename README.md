This is my own collections of various languages exercises repos, katas and koans list.

Feel free to fork and add more quality content to create a nice Syllabus for anyone wanting a full learning package.

Recommended packages to add to this :

- Glow to read Markdown files
- Zeal to have some offline docs at hand for quick reference
